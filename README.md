Project task tracking / todo list

Initial Goals of the project
----------------------------

-   Create a command line application that can be used to track the
    status of a multi-person project.
-   Explore the problems inherent in all applications regarding
    usability, testing, packaging, deployment, etc.

Rough Current Status
--------------------

-   A \"usable\" API and CLI.
-   Database location is flexible to the API, but the CLI hard codes it
    to a single user home directory.

Usage
-----

See [usage](https://cards-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/) page
for details, but here\'s a demo of how it works:

    $ cards add a todo

    $ cards add -o Brian another task

    $ cards list
         ╷       ╷       ╷
      ID │ state │ owner │ summary
    ╺━━━━┿━━━━━━━┿━━━━━━━┿━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╸
      1  │ todo  │       │ a todo
      2  │ todo  │ Brian │ another task
         ╵       ╵       ╵

    $ cards update 1 -o Brian

    $ cards finish 1

    $ cards
      ID │ state │ owner │ summary
    ╺━━━━┿━━━━━━━┿━━━━━━━┿━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╸
      1  │ done  │ Brian │ a todo
      2  │ todo  │ Brian │ another task
         ╵       ╵       ╵

    $ cards delete 1

    $ cards
      ID │ state │ owner │ summary
    ╺━━━━┿━━━━━━━┿━━━━━━━┿━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╸
      2  │ todo  │ Brian │ another task
         ╵       ╵       ╵
